# Caesar Cipher Project

This project implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption method in Python.

## Introduction

The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. It's a fun and educational way to explore cryptography!

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Subhajit-01/PRODIGY_CS_01.git
   ```

2. Change Directory
    ```bash
   cd PRODIGY_CS_01
   ```
3. Run the `caesar_cipher.py` script:
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt a message.

## Example

Suppose you want to encrypt the message "HELLO" with a shift of 3. The encrypted result would be "KHOOR."
